Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) is a rapidly accelerating area of research that will have an important impact in modern technology. It is a key ingredient of what makes self driving cars, autonomous drones, and augmented reality possible.

## A Brief History of SLAM


## Terminology
For mere mortal, among which I count myself, the jargon can be a bit overwhelming at first.


* Structure from motion (SfM)

## Papers
Visual SLAM is a complex subject, so in order to get a better understanding of it, you can't avoid a bit of heavy reading. Once you have a decent understanding of the key terminology, I recommend reading the following papers to start. The state of the art in vSLAM is every-changing, so which I will try to keep this list up-to-date, it is by no means exhaustive.

* LSD-SLAM
* ORB-SLAM
* CNN-SLAM

In future posts I plan to describe some of these papers in depth.
