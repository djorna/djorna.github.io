This is by no means a new idea. Over 2000 years ago, Plato famously posited that our model of reality might be an illusion, in his [Allegory of the Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave). For the uninitiated, the basic idea is that if you were born shackled to a cave floor, and shown only a puppet show of silhouettes projected on to the ceiling, that would be your entire reality. You would never realize that the two-dimensional puppet show is only a small subset of reality. This thought experiment is meant to make you question your own perception of reality. Is our model of the world just an illusion projected from a higher dimensional space? Are you just a brain in a vat, or the unwitting victim of some wizard's spells? It seems unlikely, but you'll have a hard time proving the antithesis.

With the invention of computing, the our concept of a simulated world has become much more sophisticated. The Matrix is arguably just an exploration of Plato's ideas in a futuristic setting. And as deep learning becomes increasingly adept at generating realistic audio and visuals, the idea of our entire reality being simulated is becoming ever-more plausible.

Which leads us to the reason this idea has recently gained some attention. Elon Musk publicly voiced his conviction that our perceived external world is most likely a simulation. The argument goes something like this. We have good reason to believe that high-fidelity simulation on the level of the Matrix is possible, with the only limits being computing power and software. And since it's much easier to deploy a server farm than it is to create a universe, there are probably more simulations that real universes. Then by simple probability, we should expect to find ourselves in one of the universes which is simulated. Q.E.D.

There are a number of assumptions hidden in this argument:

1. Simulation on a simultaneously quantum and cosmic scale, as we observe in our universe, is possible.

2. Other civilizations exist.  

This is a whole other topic unto itself, so I'll keep this brief. It's extremely hard to pin down the probability of life developing, given that we still don't exactly know how life developed on Earth, and we only know of life developing on one planet. If you 

We could also 

Conclusion: plausible.

3. Civilizations with the ability to build elaborate simulations will decide to do so

4. Advanced civilizations don't all implode due to self-inflicted catastrophe
