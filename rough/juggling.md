Summary: How an apparently useless skill can make you better at learning.


I learned to juggle when I was 10 years old. My elementary school had invited a motivational speaker who spoke for about half an hour. Most of it was the usual nonsense: believe in yourself, practice makes perfect, etc, etc. I don't remember much of what he said. But what I do remember from the experience was the interactive part at the end of the presentation, in which he taught us how to juggle. 

He showed us the most basic 3-ball cascade, and we practiced for a few minutes. Just enough time for us to realize how difficult juggling is. For most people their juggling careers ended then and there. But as with many things in life, I took it was too far. I became obsessed. I practiced for hours in the living room until I could keep a pattern going for over a minute. I watched Youtube tutorials to learn new patterns, like the "windmill" and "Mill's Mess." I eventually graduated to four balls, five balls, rings, clubs, etc. 

# The Importance of Persistence
This one is rather cliche and obvious, but it's important nonetheless. We're constantly told that learning is just a matter of practice. However, so often people see the result of years of practice and attribute it to some kind of built-in gift they they don't have. And some people are definitely gifted with impressive abilities that couldn't possibly be attributed to hard work and practice. Look no further than NBC's Genius Junior for a succict demonstration of life's inherent unfairness. But until genetic engineering becomes safe, effective, and cheap, the rest of us will have to rely on practice. Much can be achieved by simply stubbornly refusing to give up.

# Accurately Identifying the Failure Criterion 
The objective in juggling seems obvious. Keep throwing the balls, and don't let them drop. As long as you keep the balls in the air, you're juggling, and the moment of failure is when the balls hit the ground. However, this is not actually a useful way of framing the task. Juggling as a skill is mostly a matter of being able to throw the balls accurately and consistently. If you can do that, the rest follows naturally. Stopping the balls from dropping puts the focus on the act of catching the balls, but if the throws are accurate, catching them takes little effort, since your hands can just move to the location you expect the balls to land. When a single ball hits the ground, it's usually an indication of an inaccurate throw which was made earlier. 

Reinforcement learning is a long-standing research topic in psychology and artificial intelligence, most recently appearing in combination with deep learning to beat grandmaster Go players and teach robots to perform complex manipulations. It is also a useful model for human learning. The basic idea of reinforcement learning is that you set a goal, which you want to reach, and a cost function, which you want to minimize. So the key to effectively implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm is to carefully design the cost function.
