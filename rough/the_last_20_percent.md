Summary: Why the last 20 percent of a project can be the most difficult, but also the most critical.

After spending countless hours working on side projects, I found that I barely had anything to show for it. It's not that I had given up on the projects; they were basically complete. But no one cared. No one was forking my open source projects or giving me any kind of feedback. 


# Why the Last 20% is the Hardest

Looking back at the programming projects I've worked on, from hackathons to engineering clubs to personal side-projects, I've noticed that they were all cut short in one way or another. That is, they may have met the requirements at the time, be it a demo for hackathons, a report for school projects, or a an open source project that does what it set out to do, but they always had more potential that would never be seen once they were abandoned.

I think this phenomenon starts in school. We're used to working on projects to the point that it satisfies our teachers or professors. Then we write something in the report about next steps and abandon the project altogether. While you're a student, this is necessary as you have zero free time. But the problem is that once you've graduated, these old habits don't die. Your side project that could be turned into a viable business is 

# Why Should You Complete Projects?

# But I Don't Want to Start a Business
