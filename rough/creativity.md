Summary: Dispelling common misconceptions on the nature of creativity.


Creativity is a deceptively common concept. It's something that artists, musicians, web designers and similiar professions, sometimes collectively referred to as "creatives," excel at and depend on. This mysterious ability to generate original ideas from nothing  Logically, this would imply that certain other professions (engineers, scientists, mathematicians, etc.) are "non-creatives." 

But what does it actually mean to be creative?


## Which Activities are Creative? 
Creative ideas are often viewed in contrast to more analytical or logical ideas. Writing a song is considered a creative endeavor, as it results in a sequence of sounds has never been heard. On the other hand, scientific discoveries are viewed as less creative, since they must be constrained by the limits of reality.

However, both of these assesments are flawed. Music is limited by the tonal system, scales, chord progressions, and various other aspects of music theory. Occasionally, these rules may be bent or even broken, but there is a certain logical element to music.

Likewise, scientific breakthroughs often require high levels of creativity. If scientists always approached problems the same way, there would never be any progress. A classic example of this is Einstein's famous "happiest thought" during his stroll through Central Park, when he initially had the idea for General Relativity. Seeing gravity in a new way, as a warping of space-time, required lateral, creative thinking, not merely straightforward calculation. This is a common misconception of mathematicians and scientists; that they are only capable of analytical thinking.

Although we tend to have hard-and-fast labels for creative and non-creative activities, they don't tell the whole story. Classically creative activities require often some analytical thinking, and classically uncreative activities often require some amount of creativity.
