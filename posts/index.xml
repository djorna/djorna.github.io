      <description>Disclaimer: This post is sponsored by MyHub Intranet Solutions, an affiliate of Daikon Media, who were kind enough to review my indie game. However, I did my best to keep the content educational and objective, and I was not censored in any way.
Intranet vs Internet You&amp;rsquo;re might be familiar with something called &amp;ldquo;the internet.&amp;rdquo; It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. But intranet is somewhat lesser-known.</description>

      <title>Publish Your Unity Game to the App Store Without a Mac or an iPhone</title>

      <description>I recently released the beta of my first mobile game, Juggl, for both Android an iOS. Not owning any Apple products besides an old iPod Nano, I found publishing to the App Store to be more difficult than I expected. It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder some indie devs neglect the App Store altogether to save themselves the headache of getting through Apple&amp;rsquo;s strict hardware requirements.
This is unfortunate, because they&amp;rsquo;re missing out on a lot of potential revenue.</description>

      <description>Motivation Procedural terrain generation encompasses a broad range of techniques, with the goal of efficiently creating a realistic simulated environment. Some of the most famous applications of procedural terrain generation are in Minecraft, which procedurally generated biomes to simulate different climages, and No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky, which uses procedural techniques to generate entire worlds.
While video games are the most well-known application of procedural terrain generation, they are not the only application.</description>
