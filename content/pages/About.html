      Hi, I'm David Jorna. I plan to use this site to share my ideas, programming projects, and
      technical knowledge, in the hope that someone finds it to be helpful. Conventional wisdom
      says that you should keep your blog topics focused on a niche in order to gain traction,
      but I will likely cover a variety of topics. Some of my interests include artificial intelligence,
      computer vision, education, philosophy, science, and technology, so you can expect content
      along those lines.
