      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m David Jorna. I plan to use this site to share my ideas, programming projects, and technical knowledge, in the hope that someone finds it to be helpful. Conventional wisdom says that you should keep your blog topics focused on a niche in order to gain traction, but I will likely cover a variety of topics. Some of my interests include artificial intelligence, computer vision, education, philosophy, science, and technology, so you can expect content along those lines.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This post is sponsored by MyHub Intranet Solutions, an affiliate of Daikon Media, who were kind enough to review my indie game. However, I did my best to keep the content educational and objective, and I was not censored in any way.
Intranet vs Internet You&amp;rsquo;re might be familiar with something called &amp;ldquo;the internet.&amp;rdquo; It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. But intranet is somewhat lesser-known.</description>

      <title>Publish Your Unity Game to the App Store Without a Mac or an iPhone</title>

      <description>I recently released the beta of my first mobile game, Juggl, for both Android an iOS. Not owning any Apple products besides an old iPod Nano, I found publishing to the App Store to be more difficult than I expected. It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder some indie devs neglect the App Store altogether to save themselves the headache of getting through Apple&amp;rsquo;s strict hardware requirements.
This is unfortunate, because they&amp;rsquo;re missing out on a lot of potential revenue.</description>

      <description>Motivation Procedural terrain generation encompasses a broad range of techniques, with the goal of efficiently creating a realistic simulated environment. Some of the most famous applications of procedural terrain generation are in Minecraft, which procedurally generated biomes to simulate different climages, and No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky, which uses procedural techniques to generate entire worlds.
While video games are the most well-known application of procedural terrain generation, they are not the only application.</description>
