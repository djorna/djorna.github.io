      <description>I recently released the beta of my first mobile game, Juggl, for both Android an iOS. Not owning any Apple products besides an old iPod Nano, I found publishing to the App Store to be more difficult than I expected. It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder some indie devs neglect the App Store altogether to save themselves the headache of getting through Apple&amp;rsquo;s strict hardware requirements.
This is unfortunate, because they&amp;rsquo;re missing out on a lot of potential revenue.</description>
